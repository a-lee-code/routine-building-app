            <h2>Build sustainable habits and stay on track!</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Hearth & Habit is designed with the ADHD brain in mind—my own included. But it’s not just for ADHDers; it’s for anyone who struggles with structure and routine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Building a consistent and sustainable daily routine was the first step in managing my executive dysfunction, and I hope this tool helps you as much as it has helped me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Let’s create habits that feel natural, achievable, and empowering—one step at a time.</p>

            <section id="about-routines">
                <h2>Routines – Getting Started</h2>
                <p>Each routine “menu” provides dedicated spaces for your morning and evening routines. These blank spaces allow you to customize your habits based on what works best for you.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Not sure where to begin? A great starting point is choosing:</p>
                <p>
                    One habit for your mind (e.g., meditation)<br>
                    One habit for your body (e.g., yoga)<br>
                    One habit for joy (e.g., dancing to a favorite song)
                </p>
                <p>Build a routine that feels natural, supportive, and sustainable for you!</p>

                    <h2>Cleaning checklist - Getting started</h2>
                    <p>The cleaning checklist has a few basic tasks added in and plenty of blank spaces for customization.</p>
                    <br>
                     <p>I encourage you to break tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps. Aim for small tasks that take no longer than 5 mins or less, it helps with sustainability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For example, instead of listing "Clean the bathroom" as a single task, try breaking it down into individual  steps like "Wipe the sink", "Scrub the toilet", or "Sweep the floor."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Start by adding one or two tasks to both your morning and evening routines—but remember, flexibility is key.</p>
                    <p> If you’re low on energy, it’s okay to skip a day. If you have extra energy, you can always do more. The goal is progress, not perfection!</p>
